    "Financial modeling aims to use python programming to solve finance-related questions and build up models to explain return or risk. I asssume you may have some coding backgrounds in Econometrics or Investments, but it is still my job to help you to review basic concepts about the fundations of python. \\\n",
    "The fundamental logic of using python in finance world is simplifying the step that you may need to do multiple times. So the key idea before running a model is knowing how to solve this question in the first run. And that would be the fundations of Python we need to review or learn in this section. \\\n",
    "Python is a programming language, the most basic ways to type and run a python code in in the terminal. But it's too hard for a beginner to understand an apply, so that's why we need a \"developing environment\" to help us to simplify the coding environment. Jupyter Notbook is a effective tool to help you to run python codes. The financial modeling course fill practice and finish everything based on Jupyter Notebook and codings, including in-class activities, homework assignments, quizzes, exams and group project. \n"
